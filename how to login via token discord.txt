based on tor browser you should go to the login page, console, paste the login script.js, it will show error type: "allow pasting" then login via token
other browsers will do the same but some of them will just start letting commands go via "allow pasting" in most cases

how to get my token?
dev options --> enable mobile --> applocations --> token filter --> token
